# Chess---clean-code

I get this code from 
https://help.github.com/en/github/importing-your-projects-to-github/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line

Branch master consists of the initial project. I add changes and commit the file to a different branch.
Each branch has information about the change made.
